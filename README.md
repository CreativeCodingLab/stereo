stereo
======

Stereographic library for Processing 1.5.1, based on code by Paul Bourke. 
Includes code to work with the GLGraphics library (see how in the ActiveStereoTestGLGraphics demo). 
Or you can use raw OpenGL (see ActiveStereoTest and AnaglyphTest and PassiveStereoTest demos). 
Should be pretty straightforward. Feel free to send me an email at angus.forbes (at) gmail if you have questions, 
or especially if you have some demo code that uses this library.
